//WHEN I click the start button
//THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

//WHEN I answer a question
//THEN I am presented with another question

//WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
//THEN time is subtracted from the clock

//WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
//THEN the game is over

//WHEN the game is over
//THEN I can save my initials and score


/*There are several things we need to complete this.
We need a function for the timer.
We need a function for randomly selecting a question.
We need a function for randomly organizing the answers.
We need to store the high-scores.*/
